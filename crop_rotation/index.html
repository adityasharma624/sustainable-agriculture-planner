                <h2>Introduction to Crop Rotation Planner</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Crop rotation is a sustainable agricultural practice that involves growing a sequence of different crops in the same field over a period of time. This practice has many benefits, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved soil health</li>
                    <li>Reduced pest and disease pressure</li>
                    <li>Increased crop yields</li>
                    <li>Improved water use efficiency</li>
                    <li>Reduced reliance on fertilizers and pesticides</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>However, crop rotation can be complex to plan, as it requires a detailed understanding of the crops being grown, the soil conditions, and the local climate. To help farmers and growers plan effective crop rotations, we have developed this crop rotation planner.</p>
                <p>This planner takes into account the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Crop rotation principles</b>: The planner ensures that the crops you select are compatible with each other and will not compete for the same resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Regional crop rotation practices</b>: The planner provides suggestions for crop rotations that are commonly practiced in different regions of India.</li>
                    <li><b>Soil type</b>: The planner takes into account the soil type of your field to suggest crops that are well-suited to those conditions.</li>
                    <li><b>Climate</b>: The planner takes into account the local climate to suggest crops that will thrive in your area.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>While crop rotation requires every minute detail to be known of the field, we have generalized different regions and suggested what kind of rotation would be optimal in the region. This is because it is not possible to provide a one-size-fits-all crop rotation plan for every field in India.</p>

                <h2>Across India</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The following are some of the most common crop rotations used across India:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rice-Pulses</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a high rainfall. Rice is a heavy feeder crop, so it is important to rotate it with a legume crop, such as pulses, which can help to improve soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Bajra-Pulses</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a dry climate. Bajra is a drought-tolerant crop, so it is well-suited to these conditions. Pulses can be rotated with bajra to improve soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Sorghum-Pulses</b>: This rotation is also common in areas with a dry climate. Sorghum is another drought-tolerant crop, and pulses can be rotated with sorghum to improve soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Groundnut-Wheat</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a moderate climate. Groundnut is a legume crop, so it can help to improve soil fertility for the following wheat crop.</li>
                    <li><b>Soybean-Mustard</b>: This rotation is also common in areas with a moderate climate. Soybean is a legume crop, and mustard is an oilseed crop. This rotation helps to improve soil fertility and also provides a diversity of crops.</li>
                    <li><b>Maize-Pulses or Clovers</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a high rainfall. Maize is a heavy feeder crop, so it is important to rotate it with a legume crop, such as pulses or clovers, which can help to improve soil fertility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Irrigated Areas in India</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The following are some of the most common crop rotations used in the irrigated parts of India:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rice-Wheat</b>: The rice-wheat rotation is the most common crop rotation in irrigated parts of India. It is used in areas with a high rainfall and fertile soils. Rice is a heavy feeder crop, so it is important to rotate it with a cereal crop, such as wheat, which has lower nutrient requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Rice-Maize</b>: The rice-maize rotation is another common crop rotation in India. It is used in areas with a moderate rainfall and a variety of soil types. Maize is a less heavy feeder crop than rice, so it can be rotated with rice without depleting soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Maize-Wheat</b>: The maize-wheat rotation is a common crop rotation in areas with a cool and dry climate. Maize is a warm-season crop, while wheat is a cool-season crop. This means that the maize-wheat rotation allows for year-round cropping.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>

                <h2>Rain-fed Areas in India</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Rain-fed regions are areas that rely on rainfall for irrigation. This means that crop rotation is especially important in these regions, as it can help to improve soil health and water use efficiency.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the most common crop rotations used in rain-fed regions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rice-Pulses</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a high rainfall. Rice is a heavy feeder crop, so it is important to rotate it with a legume crop, such as pulses, which can help to improve soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Rice-Oilseeds</b>: This rotation is also common in areas with a high rainfall. Oilseeds, such as sesame and groundnut, are less demanding on soil fertility than rice, so they can be rotated with rice without depleting soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Maize-Pulses or Oilseeds</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a moderate rainfall. Maize is a cereal crop, so it has lower nutrient requirements than rice. This means that the maize-pulses or oilseeds rotation is less likely to deplete soil fertility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Indo-Gangetic Plains</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The Indo-Gangetic Plains is a fertile region that produces a wide variety of crops. The following are some of the most common crop rotation practices in the region:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rice-Vegetable</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a high rainfall. Rice is a heavy feeder crop, so it is important to rotate it with a vegetable crop, which can help to improve soil fertility and reduce pest and disease pressure.</li>
                    <li><b>Sugarcane-Wheat</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a warm climate and adequate irrigation. Sugarcane is a long-duration crop, so it is important to rotate it with a short-duration crop, such as wheat, to maintain soil fertility and productivity.</li>
                    <li><b>Wheat-Vegetable</b>: This rotation is similar to the rice-vegetable rotation, but it is used in areas where wheat is the main crop.</li>
                    <li><b>Wheat-Pulses</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a moderate climate. Legumes, such as pulses, can help to improve soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air.</li>
                    <li><b>Wheat-Vegetable</b>: This rotation is similar to the rice-vegetable rotation, but it is used in areas where wheat is the main crop.</li>
                    <li><b>Wheat-Fallow</b>: This rotation is used in areas where water is scarce. Fallow periods help to conserve water and improve soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><b>Sorghum-Berseem</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a dry climate. Sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop, while Berseem is a legume crop. This rotation helps to improve soil fertility and reduce pest and disease pressure.</li>
                    <li><b>Maize-Mustard</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a moderate climate. Maize is a heavy feeder crop, while mustard is an oilseed crop. This rotation helps to improve soil fertility and produce two high-value crops.</li>
                    <li><b>Mustard-Vegetable</b>: This rotation is similar to the rice-vegetable rotation, but it is used in areas where mustard is the main crop.</li>
                    <li><b>Maize-Wheat</b>: This rotation is common in areas with a moderate climate. Maize is a heavy feeder crop, while wheat is a cereal crop. This rotation helps to improve soil fertility and produce two high-yielding crops.</li>
