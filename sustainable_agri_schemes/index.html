            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>India's agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation, driven by the need to address environmental concerns, enhance productivity, and improve farmer livelihoods. Sustainable agriculture practices are gaining prominence as a means to achieve these goals. Various states in India are implementing sustainable agriculture schemes and initiatives to promote these practices among farmers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh are major contributors to the country's agricultural output. However, the intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in these states has raised concerns about environmental sustainability and the long-term health of the soil. To address these concerns, the state governments have implemented various sustainable agriculture schemes to promote eco-friendly farming practices.</p>

            <h2>Punjab</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Punjab government has introduced several initiatives to encourage sustainable agriculture, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Happy Seeder Scheme</b>: The Happy Seeder is a machine that enables farmers to sow wheat directly into paddy stubble without burning it, promoting sustainable farming practices. Developed by the Punjab Agricultural University, the Happy Seeder cuts through stubble and sows wheat seeds in a single pass, saving time, labor, and controlling weeds. The Indian government's subsidy scheme encourages Happy Seeder adoption, reducing stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.</li>
                <li><b>Crop Diversification Scheme</b>: Punjab's Crop Diversification Scheme (CDS) aims to reduce paddy cultivation and promote alternative crops, enhance soil health, and boost farmer incomes. Farmers are offered financial incentives to grow alternative crops, such as maize, basmati rice, and cotton. The government also conducts awareness campaigns and sets up demonstration plots to educate farmers about the benefits of crop diversification. In addition, the government provides market linkages to help farmers sell their crops at fair prices.</li>
                <li><b>Micro Irrigation Scheme</b>: The Punjab Micro Irrigation Scheme aims to promote water conservation and improve irrigation efficiency in the state's agriculture sector. The scheme provides subsidies to farmers for the installation of micro-irrigation systems, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation. These systems can save up to 80% of water compared to traditional flood irrigation methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Haryana</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Haryana government has also implemented a range of sustainable agriculture schemes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Meri Fasal Mera Byora</b>: The main objective of this scheme is to collect complete details of the crops of the farmers and pay them fair price according to their crops. The objective of this scheme is to provide good prices to the farmers by taking complete details of all the expenses incurred on their crops like food, seeds, loan, agricultural equipment etc. and providing them good prices accordingly. Subsidy will also be provided to farmers under this scheme.</li>
                <li><b>Mera Pani-Meri Virasat</b>: Under the Mera Pani-Meri Virasat, scheme started in Kharif-2020, the government is providing financial assistance of Rs 7,000 per acre to the farmers for diversifying the paddy crop with alternative crops like maize, cotton, millet, pulses, vegetables and fruits, the statement quoted Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar as saying.</li>

            <p>The Uttar Pradesh government has taken several steps to promote sustainable agriculture, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna</b>: The program aims to comprehensively develop the horticulture sector through localized strategies, enhance production, improve nutrient conservation, bolster farmer income, synergize existing development initiatives, promote technological advancements, foster employment opportunities, ensure fair producer income, and transform traditional crop regions into horticultural hubs.</li>
                <li><b>National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)</b>: The program strives to enhance agricultural productivity, sustainability, profitability, and climate resilience by promoting location-specific integrated farming systems, conserving natural resources through soil and moisture conservation measures, adopting comprehensive soil health management practices, optimizing water resource utilization, building capacity among farmers and stakeholders, piloting models for improving rainfed farming productivity, and fostering effective inter- and intra-departmental coordination.</li>
